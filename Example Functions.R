########################### IQV or Diversity ###################################
#This statistic is the diversity of a group of individuals.
#This is the general equation for IQV
#
#      âˆ‘(number in a category / total people ^ 2) /
#           (1 - (1 / number of categories))
#
#Common Example Statistics:
#     Race IQV; diversity of race w/in an individuals' network
#     Sex IQV; diversity of sex w/in an individuals' network
#
#Statistical notes:
# - As IQV scales with the number of possible categories
#  individuals can fall into, having categories in your data that very few
#  individuals fall into can cause abnormally low IQV levels. For example, if
#  you have 5 categories for pets, but 98% of individuals only own cats or dogs,
#  then you may end up with much lower IQV's than you would if the other 3 pet
#  categories were combined into one "other" category.
# - IQV is not a linear statistic unlike Proportion or Homophily
# - Our version of IQV does not work with checkbox statistics, or statistics in
#  which inviduals can have more than 1 possible category they fall into. There
#  may be better measures of diversity which can accomodate this state, but
#  unfortunately we do not have it.

iqv_calculator <- function(input_alters, possible_categories = NA){
	#Creating function which will be recursively used in calculations
	iqv_chunk <- function(cat_count, alter_total){
		sapply(cat_count,function(x){(x/alter_total)^2})
	}
	#Number of alters w/ logic for removing NA's
	alter_total <- sum(!is.na(input_alters))

	#Possible categories
	if(!any(is.na(possible_categories))){
		#If we have no factor but defined categories, then we use them
		possible_categories_count <- possible_categories %>% length()
	}else if(is.factor(input_alters)){
		#If we have factors we default use their levels
		possible_categories <- input_alters %>% levels()
		possible_categories_count <- possible_categories %>% length()

		#If we have no factor, and if no categories we use uniques
		possible_categories <- input_alters %>% unique()
		possible_categories_count <- possible_categories %>% length()
	}
	
	#Each category count
	cat_count <- sapply(possible_categories, function(x){sum(input_alters %in% x)})

########################## Homophily/Homogeneity ###############################
#This statistic is the number of individuals w/in a network who are the same as
#  the ego/respondent of the survey. Technically the only difference between
#  homophily and proportion is the value we are comparing to, therefore they use
#  the same function but require different inputs
#
# Common Example Statistics
#     Racial homophily; do respondents surround themselves with members of the
#       same race or ethnicity
#     Professional Homophily; do respondents surround themselves w/ individuals
#       working in the same profession
#     Class homophily; do respondents surround themselves w/ indivdidausl of the
#       same social class/socioeconomic status
#
#Theory Notes: Although statistically Homophily and Homogeneity are calculated
#  the same way; they are seperate concepts. Homogeneity is simply an
#  observation of a network: the proportion of members of a network who are the
#  same as the ego/respondent. However, homophily contains within it an implicit
#  argument: that individuals will actively or passively surround themselves
#  with individuals who are like themselves. This pattern is well studied and
#  understood to exist within networks, but depending upon hypotheses and
#  evidence provided it may be a good idea to lean on the more conservative side
#  of things and refer to this statistic as Homogeneity.
#
#Statistical Notes:
# - For this statistic to work you must have data for the ego/respondent and
#   members of their network have the exact same possible categories for them to
#   fall into. This means that usage of this statistic requires careful planning
#   of matching ego and alter ?'s with each other, or processing either set of
#   data to best match the other. If this is not the case, then using other
#   statistics may be a good idea.
# - Unlike proportion, homophily as a statistic only needs to be represented by
#   a single variable as it references the categories of the ego/respondent.
# - Homophily is dependent upon having data from the ego/respondent. This means
#   depending upon data quality you may have a larger number of NA's than other
#   statistics.

############################### Proportion #####################################
#This statistic is pretty simple to understand, it is simply the number of
#  individuals with a certain value or set of values divided by the total number
#  of individuals.
#
# Common Example Statistics
#     Proportion Kin: Are respondents' networks predominantly family members, or
#       non-familial friends/associates
#     Proportion Unhealthy Ties: Do respondents' networks consist of individuals
#       w/ negative health habits (e.g. smoking, heavy drinking, unhealthy diet,
#       little to no exercise, etc.)
#
#Statistical Notes:
# - For a number of reasons proportion is a statistic needing much more
# customization to the study at hand. It may be a good idea to set up what
# questions we want to answer about networks and their composition beforehard.
# This way analysts are not bogged down in looking at every possible combination
# of factors.
# - Unlike IQV and Homophily, proportion is not collapsed into a single
# variable. Instead you may need to have a seperate proportion variable for
# every level or possible combination of levels. For example, if you have a
# cohort of dog owners, cat owners, and guinea pig owners; you may need to have
# prop_dog, prop_cat, and prop_guineapig to cover every value. You may be able
# to combine statistics (e.g. prop_nondog) but this is dependent upon what your
# study is trying to understand about the composition of the networks.
# - Continuing this line of thought; for variables which can contain multiple
# possible values it may be likely that proportions do not seem to line up in a
# easy to conceptualize manner. For example, if you have a cohort of dog owners,
# cat owners, and guinea pig owners; it may be possible to own both cats and
# dogs. This means that network w/ 3 people, two of whom have cats and dogs,
# while one has guinea pigs, will give these values: dogs - 0.66, cats - 0.66,
# guinea pigs - 0.33. Notice how these proportions add up to greater than 1.
# This can expand dramatically in wholistic analysis where individual
# proportions will be dramatically lower than their combined statistic.

############################## Example Tables ##################################

# Simple dplyr Example #########################################################
#In this table I show how to do composition analysis using dplyr pipelines. This
#  method is quite clean and doesn't require any data transformation after
#  analysis. However, I've found that it can be a bit fiddly at times. For
#  example we don't use subset for extracting ego data in the "race homophily"
#  example. This is due to both datasets using the same name and values for
#  record_id, causing overlap where there shouldn't be. Its very likely I'm
#  simply inexperienced with the tools and there may be a elegant solution to
#  this issue, but it works in this case.

#I would advise using this method if you are planning on doing simple
#  proportion/IQV calculations and just want a usable dataframe without having
#  to fiddle w/ names and formatting

alter_frame %>%                #our input alter_frame

#  columns. I find this method to be much more flexible than dplyr, but it does

#I would advise using this method if you are planning on doing analysis more
