File organization: clean_data1 and clean_data2 are depricated versions of data analysis for PersNet data, they will function adequately however are limited in their ability to be modified. data_feedback is a code which constructs network graphs or sociograms from survey questions. ego_data is a code which processes data focused on the subject of the survey, as well as network statistics for their personal network. alter_data is a code which organises alter data into "tall" format for easier analysis. Example Functions finalizes basic analysis of ego and alter data into a single processed dataset, as well it provides tutorialization on the statistics and processes for analysing PersNet data.

File naming: Files names include data last saved, project name, code/series function, and file type (20180807_PersonalNetworks_cleandata1_code.R)

File storage location: The files are all stored in the project repository at https://github.com/AmarDhand/PersonalNetworks
